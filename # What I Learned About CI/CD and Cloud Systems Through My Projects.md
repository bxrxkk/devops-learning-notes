# devops-learning-notes


Overview

This document summarises what I have learnt about DevOps, CI/CD pipelines and cloud systems through my programming projects, certifications and hands-on play with them. It's my concept of how today's software is developed, tested, and delivered reliably at scale.

From Programming Code to Writing Systems

Through my Python and C++ projects I realised that writing working code is only one aspect of delivering software. Reliability, automation, testing, and monitoring are also just as important to ensure systems behave properly in real-world environments.

I started thinking more about the way code gets from development to production and how automation minimizes human error.

CI/CD Concepts I Learned

While working on my projects, I have explored the following concepts of the CI/CD process:

Automated testing for bug detection early
Continuous integration to check code changes regularly
Build pipelines to provide repeatable and reliable deployments
Version control workflows for collaboration and rolling back

I learned in the text that CI/CD pipelines help to improve speed, consistency and system reliability by eliminating manual steps from the deployment process.

Automation and Scripting

With the help of python, I have automated monotonic tasks like testing, debugging and validation. This helped me understand the role of automation in supporting DevOps in by:

Reducing manual effort
Improving reliability
Making systems easier to maintain & scale

Automation became an important instrument for enhancing efficiency and consistency within workflow.

Cloud and Infrastructure Awareness

Through AWS training and virtual work experience, I got exposure to:

Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Compute services such as EC2
Protective authentication and access control
The importance of having security and reliability in mind when designing systems

I learned about how cloud infrastructure allows a system to be scalable and flexible but also how you need to manage access, cost, and availability.

Monitoring, Reliability, & Improvement

I learned that DevOps is not only about deployment, but also how to maintain systems over the years. Monitoring the behaviour of systems, finding the failure points, and iterating on designs are critical for long-term reliability.

This reinforced the importance of continuous improvement and learning from the system behaviour in production-like environments.

Key Takeaways

DevOps is concerned with the complete lifecycle of the software, not only development
Automation for improved Reliability and Efficiency
CI/CD pipelines have less risk and faster delivery
The design and security and access of cloud systems need to be considered
Continuous learning in rapidly changing technical environments

Next Steps

I plan to continue to build small projects which focus on automation, CI/CD workflow, 'cloud fundamentals' and also gain a better understanding of monitoring and system reliability.
